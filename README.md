# AndroidDynPermissions
 Delphi Android Dynamic Permissions


This class allows Delphi developers to safely handle Android permissions without risking app crashes when making permission requests during form creation or in overridden constructors. It dynamically retrieves permissions from the Android runtime manifest in their required order, ensuring the app remains stable. This careful ordering is crucial for preventing crashes during permission handling.
